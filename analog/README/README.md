#Algorithmus *analog*

The first of three tasks was all about algorithms. First, we should think about an analog conceptual formulation for an picture we want others to create within 30 seconds without any additional statment from us. For example we had to decide which material, paper and colors should be used, or any other specific parameter to conceive an unique in advance expectable result. In two weeks of testing and improving I developed this algorithm:

>**Follow the instructions on a horizontal format sheet of white paper in A4:**

>take a red pencil

>draw vertical ordered, on vertex touching rhombi from the top to the bottom of the sheet

>size has to be between two to four fingerbreadth

>positiones of rhombuslines are random, they can get close but do not touch

>draw alternating red and green rows until the time is over
