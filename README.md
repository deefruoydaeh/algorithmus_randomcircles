##Algorithmus *analog*

The first of three tasks were all about algorithms. First, we had to think about an analog conceptual formulation for a picture we wanted others to create within 30 seconds without any additional statment. For example we had to decide which material, paper and colors should be used, or any other specific parameter to conceive a unique and advanced expectable result. In two weeks of testing and improving I developed this algorithm:

>**Follow the instructions on a horizontal format sheet of white paper in A4:**

>take a red pencil

>draw vertical ordered, on vertex touching rhombi from the top to the bottom of the sheet

>size has to be between two to four fingerbreadth

>positiones of rhombuslines are random, they can get close but do not touch

>draw alternating red and green rows until the time is over


###The Results

Without any other direction than the algorithm, I recieved multifarious results. For me some are easy to comprehend because the instructions also gives you little interpretable space. But some others are very funny and surprising and a bit unaccountable.

##Algorithmus *digital*

After making an analog algorithm, we continuted to convert it into digital form. 
I chose to try out the programming language "Processing" but I wanted to recieve a more interesting and beautiful 
result and changed the directions. To the rhombuslines I added six bubbles with random but harmonic colors, 
which sizes and arrangements are varied by chance. The rhombi should not be red and green anymore. 
I wanted them to receive a neutral tone of grey, the same as the background, so they would only be visible in
front of the Bubbles.

###The Results

When running the code, you receive one or another pretty composition. I am especially pleased by the color 
arrangements that sometimes arise.

###Prerequisite

1. computer

2. Processing (freeware)

###Usage

The result appears in an other window after running the code. If you want a langer or smaller size, I tried to make the code as easy al possible to adjust.
