##Algorithmus *digital*

After making an analog, we continuted to convert our algorithm into digital form. 
I choosed to try out the programming language "Processing" but I wanted to recieve an more interesting and beautiful 
result and changed the directions. To the rhombuslines I added six bubbles with random but harmonic colors, 
which size and arrangement is also determinate by chance. The rhombi should not be red and green anymore. 
I wanted them to be a neutral tone of grey, the same as the background, so they would be only visible in
front of the Bubbles.

##The Results

When running the code, you recieve one or another pretty composition. I am especially pleased by the color 
arrangements.
