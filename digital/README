##Algorithmus *digital*

After making an analog, we continuted to convert our algorithm into digital form. 
I choosed to try out the programming language "Processing" but I wanted to recieve an more interesting and beautiful 
result and changed the directions. To the rhombuslines I added six bubbles with random but harmonic colors, 
which size and arrangement is also determinate by chance. The rhombi should not be red and green anymore. 
I wanted them to be a neutral tone of grey, the same as the background, so they would be only visible in
front of the Bubbles.

##The Results

Without any other direction than the algorithm, I recieved multifarious results. Some are easy to comprehend for me because the instructions also gives you little interpretable space. But some others are very funny and surprising and a bit unaccountable.
